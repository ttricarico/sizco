Sizco
=====

Sizco is a quest to make a very simple cms in php which contains only three main components:
1) A routing system which directs to the pages.
2) A database component to save information
3) A system to load pages, either dynamically or by static files


Everything will be added by plugins, so if you don't need something (such as an admin console), you can just omit it.
